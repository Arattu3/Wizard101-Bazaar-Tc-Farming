# Wizard101-Bazaar-Tc-Farming
I was in a desperate need of some rare/uncommon treasure cards so I could maintain my pvp career(lol). So while I was manually clicking refresh and looking for treasure cards I need, it hit me that I could create a bot to do it for me. Eventually, I had more than enough tc's so I decided to look for a way to make a profit out of this. I found a discord server for trading where I "sold" my treasure cards for empower(which were traded for crowns items in the same server). At that time I wasn't even playing the game I was just trading to get more empowers to buy crown items from players(because let's face it, crowns are expensive). I stopped playing the game about 6 months ago because I realized that it was a huge time killer and all I had been doing was trading. Recently. I've decided to start uploading my bots to github to see if someone's interested. This is the first bot I've decided to upload and they are many more to come. Feel free to contact me about anything.
